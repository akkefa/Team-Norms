# Culture of Excellence

## Extreme Ownership
Foster accountability. For example:
- If a model fails in production, the engineer leads the post-mortem and solution.
- Celebrate failures as learning opportunities (e.g., "Best Failure of the Month" award).

## Relentless Automation
- Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, A/B testing).
- Build shared tools (e.g., a Python library for feature engineering reused across projects).

## Speed Over Perfection
- Encourage rapid prototyping (e.g., test a new algorithm in 2 days vs. 2 weeks).
- Use "good enough" solutions first, then iterate (e.g., deploy a logistic regression MVP before a neural network).

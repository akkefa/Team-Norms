# Process Optimization

## Agile with a Twist

- Use 1-week sprints for experimentation and 2-week sprints for production work.
- Daily standups focused on blockers only ("Whatâ€™s stopping you?").

## Focus on Leverage

- Prioritize projects with 10x ROI (e.g., automating a process that saves 100 hours/month).
- Kill low-impact work ruthlessly (e.g., deprecate models with <1% business impact).

## Metrics-Driven Execution

- Track leading indicators (e.g., experiment velocity, deployment frequency).
- Set OKRs like "Reduce model training time by 50%" or "Increase prediction accuracy by 5% MoM."

# Leadership, Clear Vision and Goals

## 1. Strategic Alignment
- **Why it matters:** People perform best when they understand the purpose of their work and how it impacts the broader mission.
- **How to achieve it:**
  - Share the high-level company or product vision with the team.
  - Translate that vision into clear, measurable objectives (e.g., product metrics, model performance metrics, or user engagement targets).
  - Revisit these objectives regularly (e.g., at sprint planning or quarterly reviews) so everyone remains aligned.

## 2. Prioritized Roadmap
- **Why it matters:** A team that lacks focus will be spread too thin, negatively impacting output.
- **How to achieve it:**
  - Co-create a roadmap that prioritizes tasks (from must-have to nice-to-have).
  - Avoid “task stacking” without revisiting priorities—reassess regularly to keep the backlog clean.

## Set a Compelling Vision
- Define clear mission with measurable outcomes  
  *Example: "Reduce customer churn by 50% in 12 months through ML"*
- Align team around North Star metrics

## Empower Ownership
- Delegate end-to-end project ownership:
  - Experimental design
  - Implementation
  - Deployment
  - Monitoring
  
## Lead by Example
- Maintain technical hands-on involvement:
  - Weekly code contributions
  - Model review sessions
  - Pipeline debugging

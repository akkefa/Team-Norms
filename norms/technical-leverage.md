# Technical Leverage

## MLOps Infrastructure

- Invest in CI/CD pipelines for ML (e.g., GitHub Actions, MLflow, Kubeflow).
- Standardize environments (Docker containers, PyPI private packages).
- Enable one-click model retraining and deployment.

## High-Quality Data

- Build a centralized feature store (e.g., Feast, Tecton).
- Automate data validation (e.g., Great Expectations).

## Tooling

- Use productivity boosters like GPT-4 for code generation, Jupyter AI for exploration, or Metaflow for workflow orchestration.
- Eliminate tool fragmentation (e.g., enforce a single framework like PyTorch for all projects).
